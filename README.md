# Hack-1-Thing-CCCS Claire Collins and Connor Spencer
For our Hack-1-Thing we decided to attempt setting up a shell website that communicates with a database through a login. We chose this project because we wanted to see what a full tech stack could like for a website. First we learned basic html and css. We created a page with a mainpage that introduces our concept, a login, and signup page. The login and signups handled information using php to be sent to our database. Being able to excute php was a barrier for us as it required running the pages from a webserver. We also researched both sql and nosql databases specifically mysql and mongodb. We decided to opt for mysql because there was more documentation and there was a lot of set up to run mongodb that was confusing. When run through Xampp our website sends information

To run:
Install xampp create directory "music-fi" and move directory into htdocs

Then run proj.html throug browser by either localhost/music-fi/proj.html or {insert Ip adress}/music-fi/proj.html
